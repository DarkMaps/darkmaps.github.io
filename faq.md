      - question: Why did you make Dark Maps?
        answer: >-
          Whether you're driving a long distance, going for a bike ride or meeting a friend, letting others know your location is important for safety and to keep others updated. However, your location is one of the most private pieces of information you share on the internet. Dark Maps will give you complete control over who you share your location with, for how long it is shared, and where that data is stored.
      - question: What are the benefits of subscribing?
        answer: >-
          Subscribing to Dark Maps enables users to send 'Live Messages', meaning you can set your location to be sent to others on a regular basis for a specified amount of time. Once the allocated time is up Dark Maps will stop sharing your location with that user. More features are planned in the future.
      - question: Where does my subscription go?
        answer: >-
          Initially, subscriptions will go towards managing and upkeep of the Dark Maps servers. Until Dark Maps has undergone a security audit any additional profit will be put towards this.
      - question: Has Dark Maps undergone a security audit?
        answer: >-
          Not yet. Dark Maps has been made by a single developer as a passion project with zero budget. Any profit left over from subscription purchases after the servers have been paid for will be put towards hiring an auditor.
      - question: How do I use two-factor authentication?
        answer: >-
          Once you have registered an email address and logged into the Dark Maps app go to the settings page. Click the 'Activate 2FA' button. A QR code will be displayed. Use either the [Authy](https://authy.com) or [Google Authenticator](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605) apps to scan this QR code. A six digit code will then be displayed. Copy this code into the text box below the QR Code in the Dark Maps app and click 'Activate'. If everything is successful then the next time you log in you will be required to enter the six digit code again before gaining access to the app.
      - question: What is the 'Signal Protocol'?
        answer: >-
          The Signal Protocol is an encryption protocol created by Open Whisper Systems in 2013. It enables messages to be sent in total confidentiality. Vital cryptographic security elements are provided including message authentication, forward secrecy, future secrecy and asynchronicity. Dark Maps has no affiliation with Open Whisper Systems, or the Signal App. The protocol is published [here](https://signal.org/docs/), and the source code used for encryption in Dark Maps can be found [here](https://github.com/signalapp/libsignal-client).
      - question: What does open source mean?
        answer: >-
          Wikipedia defines open source software as ['source code that is made freely available for possible modification and redistribution'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source). The source code for Dark Maps is available [here](https://github.com/DarkMaps/DarkMaps) and the server code can be found [here](https://github.com/DarkMaps/Dark-Maps-Server).
      - question: How do I self-host the server?
        answer: >-
          The [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/DarkMaps/Dark-Maps-Server) contains instructions. The server is built on [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com). You can either run the Django app itself, or use the [Docker](https://www.docker.com) container also found in the repository.
